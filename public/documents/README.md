### ðŸ“„ Documents Folder

This folder is intended for uploading PDF documents such as resumes, CVs, and cover letters.

#### Recommended Files
- `resume.pdf` â€“ Resume file
- `cv.pdf` â€“ Curriculum Vitae (CV)
- `cover-letter.pdf` â€“ Cover/Application Letter

#### File Naming Guidelines
- Use lowercase, hyphenated or underscored filenames (e.g., `cover-letter.pdf`)
- Avoid spaces and special characters
- PDF format is preferred for maximum compatibility

#### Expected File Paths
The site assumes documents are located at:
- `/public/documents/resume.pdf`
- `/public/documents/cv.pdf`
- `/public/documents/cover-letter.pdf`

Make sure to either match these filenames or update the file references in `components/resume.tsx` accordingly.
